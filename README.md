> **Interactive Demo UI:**  
> The GitHub repo includes a FastAPI-powered **Demo Web UI** for testing retrieval behavior, inspecting ranked results, adding documents, and tuning search parameters. See **[Demo Web UI](#demo-web-ui)** for setup instructions.

A lightweight **BM25S-powered lexical retrieval package** for Python applications, REST services, LLM systems, and MCP-based tool workflows.

Use it to search documents, route LLM tool calls, filter MCP-discovered tools, and build fast lexical retrieval layers without running a vector database.

![BM25S Retriever LLM Architecture](images/vrraj-bm25s-retriever-llm.png)

<center><em>Figure: BM25S Retriever architecture for tool routing and context filtering</em></center>

## Why this exists

LLM applications often have too much context available: too many tools, too many documents, too many chunks, and too many near-duplicate choices.

This becomes more important in agentic systems where the LLM may have access to large tool registries. As the number of tools grows (20+), this becomes a scaling problem: context size increases, token costs rise, and tool selection becomes less reliable.

> `vrraj-bm25s-retriever` gives you a small, deterministic lexical **retrieval layer** that can sit before an LLM and narrow the candidate set **before prompt assembly**.
> This package is designed for applications where many tools are available, but only a small subset is relevant for any given request.

Typical flow:

```text
User Query / Prompt → BM25S Retrieval with stemming → Filtered Tools / Documents → LLM Context → Execution
```

This becomes especially important in systems with large tool registries, where user intent maps to a **bounded set of actions**: trading, customer support, CRM, finance workflows, operations, and other tool-driven systems.

In these domains, the retrieval problem is often not broad semantic discovery. It is selecting the right tool, command, document, or workflow from a known set of possibilities.

>Clear action language matters: tool names, workflow names, order actions, support tasks, CRM operations, command phrases, and domain-specific vocabulary.

## Usage Patterns

### YAML-Based Static Registries
Define tools and documents in YAML files for static, version-controlled registries. Ideal for:
- Pre-defined tool catalogs
- Document collections that don't change frequently
- Version-controlled knowledge bases
- Startup-time loading of known tool sets

```yaml
# tools.yaml
- id: get_customer_profile
  title: Get Customer Profile
  content: Lookup customer account details
  keywords: ["customer", "profile", "account"]
```

### Runtime Document/Tool Injection
Add tools and documents dynamically at runtime. Ideal for:
- MCP-discovered tools from external servers
- Combining static YAML with dynamic tool discovery
- Multi-source document aggregation
- Real-time tool registry updates

```python
# Inject MCP-discovered tools at runtime
mcp_tools = [
    Document(
        id="mcp_tool_1",
        title="MCP Tool",
        content="Description from MCP server",
        keywords=["mcp", "tool"],
        metadata={"source": "mcp"}
    )
]
retriever.add_documents(mcp_tools)
```

### Remote Service-Oriented Architecture
Run BM25S as a standalone HTTP service. Ideal for:
- Multi-application environments sharing the same index
- Microservices architecture
- Remote deployments (BM25S on separate server)
- Service-oriented integration patterns

```bash
# Start BM25S REST service
pip install "vrraj-bm25s-retriever[server]"
bm25s-server --config settings.yaml
```

```python
# Connect from any application
from bm25s_retriever import BM25SClient
client = BM25SClient("http://remote-server:9200")
results = client.retrieve_documents("query")
```

### MCP Tool Injection
Combine MCP tool discovery with BM25S retrieval. Ideal for:
- Agentic systems with MCP servers
- Dynamic tool routing in LLM applications
- Filtering MCP tools before LLM context assembly
- Hybrid static + dynamic tool registries

```python
# Load static tools from YAML
retriever = BM25SRetriever(document_file="tools.yaml")

# Inject MCP-discovered tools (implement discover_mcp_tools() for your MCP client)
# Note: add_documents() expects List[Document] - see API Documentation for Document signature
mcp_tools = discover_mcp_tools()  # TODO: Implement MCP tool discovery
retriever.add_documents(mcp_tools)

# Search across both sources
results = retriever.retrieve_documents("user query")
```

- **API Documentation:** https://vrraj.github.io/bm25s-retriever/

## Quick start

### Option A: Use directly in Python

*For Python applications (most common)*

Requires only the base package (no server extras):

```bash
pip install vrraj-bm25s-retriever
```

```python
from bm25s_retriever import BM25SRetriever, Document

retriever = BM25SRetriever()

retriever.add_documents([
    Document(
        id="create_order",
        title="Create Order",
        content="Place a buy or sell order for a stock or equity trade.",
        keywords=["place order", "buy order", "sell order", "stock trade"],
        metadata={"category": "trading", "type": "tool"},
    ),
    Document(
        id="get_market_movers",
        title="Get Market Movers",
        content="Retrieve top gaining, losing, or most active market movers.",
        keywords=["market movers", "top gainers", "top losers", "most active"],
        metadata={"category": "trading", "type": "tool"},
    ),
])

results = retriever.retrieve_documents("place a limit buy order")

for doc in results["documents"]:
    print(doc["id"], doc["title"], doc["score_percentage"])
```

### Option B: Use as a REST service

*For shared services and web UI*

Install with server dependencies (includes FastAPI, Uvicorn, Jinja2):

```bash
pip install "vrraj-bm25s-retriever[server]"
```

Start the server:

```bash
bm25s-server --config settings.yaml
```

Search documents:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9200/retrieve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "show open customer orders"}'
```

Use the Python HTTP client:

```python
from bm25s_retriever import BM25SClient

client = BM25SClient("http://localhost:9200")
results = client.retrieve("show open customer orders")

print(f"Found {len(results['documents'])} matching tools/documents")
```

### Option C: Run the example script

*For quick testing (not production)*

```bash
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrraj/bm25s-retriever/main/examples/bm25s_basic_usage.py
python bm25s_basic_usage.py
```

## Primary use case: LLM and MCP tool routing

In LLM-driven systems, exposing every available tool to the model increases token usage, creates context bloat, and makes tool selection less reliable as registries grow.

This package works best when user intent maps to a bounded set of actions: quotes, market movers, order placement, customer order lookup, CRM updates, follow-up emails, escalations, and similar workflow-driven tasks.

BM25S can retrieve the most relevant tools before the LLM sees the tool list. This works with traditional tool registries, agent frameworks, and **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** clients.

With MCP, servers can standardize **tool discovery**, but tool discovery is not the same as tool selection. The MCP client, host application, or orchestrator still decides which discovered tools should be passed to the LLM. BM25S acts as the relevance layer between discovery and prompt assembly.

Mental model:

```text
Discover / Load → Inject → Index → Filter → Focused LLM Context
```

In practice:

```text
YAML Tool Registry + MCP-Discovered Tools + Internal Tool Definitions
→ Inject into BM25S Index (REST or in-process)
→ Query-Time Tool Filtering
→ Focused LLM Context
```

Tools can come from YAML, MCP discovery, or internal registries. The client or orchestration layer transforms these into BM25S documents and injects them into a unified in-memory index. At query time, BM25S filters the relevant subset before passing tools to the LLM.

Hybrid registry pattern:

```text
YAML Tool Registry + MCP-Discovered Tools → Dynamic BM25S Index → Query-Time Tool Filtering
```

You can start with your own YAML-based tool registry and augment it at runtime. If an MCP server discovers additional tools, the client or orchestration layer can transform those tool definitions into BM25S documents and add them to the retriever index. This lets static tool definitions and newly discovered MCP tools participate in the same lexical search and ranking flow.

Useful for domains like:

- Trading and market data tools
- Customer support workflows
- CRM and sales operations
- Finance and account workflows
- Internal enterprise tools and MCP server tool catalogs
- Hybrid RAG pipelines

Benefits:

- Combine static YAML tool definitions, MCP-discovered tools, and internal tool definitions in the same BM25S retrieval index
- Filter MCP-discovered tools on demand before passing tool definitions to the LLM
- Reduce tool context from large registries to a small, relevant candidate set
- Lower token usage, latency, and cost by avoiding unnecessary tool definitions in the prompt
- Improve tool selection when tools have narrow, specific purposes
- Return metadata with retrieved tools/documents so the client or orchestrator can apply its own scope, policy, or routing logic
- Keep routing deterministic and explainable

Example:

```bash
python examples/llm_tool_routing_example.py
```

See:

- [examples/llm_tool_routing_example.py](https://github.com/vrraj/bm25s-retriever/blob/main/examples/llm_tool_routing_example.py)

## Other use cases

### Domain-constrained retrieval

Use BM25S to search curated document sets, tool registries, or MCP tool catalogs where the language is controlled and exact matches matter.

The tool catalog does not have to be static. Applications can load a YAML registry at startup, then add or refresh tool definitions discovered from MCP servers during runtime.

Examples:

- Trading actions and market-data tools
- Support case workflows
- CRM tasks and follow-up actions
- Internal process documentation
- Compliance or policy snippets

### Hybrid RAG

BM25S works well alongside embeddings, especially when you want lexical precision before or alongside semantic search:

- Use BM25S for keyword precision
- Use embeddings for semantic recall
- Merge or rerank results before passing context to the LLM

This is helpful when semantic retrieval may miss exact tool names, workflow names, commands, abbreviations, or domain-specific terms.

Vector search is powerful for broad semantic discovery, but it can add latency and cost when embedding calls are required at runtime or when the system has to sort through many semantically similar matches. For bounded tool-selection problems, a lexical pass can be faster, cheaper, and easier to reason about.

### Lightweight retrieval service

For small-to-medium document sets, BM25S can be enough by itself:

- No vector database required
- Fast in-memory retrieval
- Deterministic scoring
- Simple deployment
- Easy YAML-based configuration

## Demo Web UI

The GitHub repository includes a FastAPI-powered demo UI for testing retrieval behavior, inspecting ranked results, adding documents, and tuning search parameters.

It also acts as an interactive tuning environment. You can load your own YAML documents or tool definitions, test retrieval parameters such as temperature, softmax scoring, and cutoff settings, and iteratively refine keywords and tool descriptions using the included UI.

This helps you visualize the ranking logic and see how tools or documents are prioritized before pushing retrieval settings into production.

## Search response schema

```python
{
    "success": bool,
    "message": str,
    "documents": [
        {
            "id": str,
            "title": str,
            "content": str,
            "keywords": list[str],
            "metadata": dict,
            "bm25_score": float,
            "score_percentage": float,
            "rank": int,
        }
    ],
    "total_retrieved": int,
    "cutoff_percentage": float,
    "settings": {
        "temperature": float,
        "ignore_zero": bool,
        "llm_tools_cutoff": float,
    },
}
```

## Document schema

```python
{
    "id": str,
    "title": str,
    "content": str,
    "keywords": list[str],
    "metadata": dict,
}
```

Searchable fields:

- `title`
- `content`
- `keywords`

Reference fields:

- `id`
- `metadata`
- `parameters` when present in YAML tool definitions

`metadata` is returned with each document/tool result so the client or orchestration layer can decide how to use it for routing, display, filtering, policy checks, or downstream logic.

## Configuration

### settings.yaml

```yaml
bm25s:
  temperature: 0.5          # Softmax temperature control
  ignore_zero: true         # Filter out zero-score results
  llm_tools_cutoff: 10.0    # Minimum softmax score percentage

documents:
  source: "source_files/tools_list.yaml"
  auto_reload: true

server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 9200
  reload: false
```

### tools_list.yaml

```yaml
documents:
  - id: "get_customer_orders"
    title: "Get Customer Orders"
    content: "Retrieve open, closed, priority, delayed, or historical customer orders."
    keywords: ["orders", "customer orders", "open orders", "order history"]
    metadata:
      category: "customer_support"
      type: "tool"
```

### Environment variables

```bash
# Server configuration
BM25S_HOST=0.0.0.0
BM25S_PORT=9200
BM25S_RELOAD=false

# Document configuration
BM25S_DOCUMENTS_PATH=./source_files/tools_list.yaml
BM25S_AUTO_RELOAD=true

# BM25S defaults
BM25S_TEMPERATURE=0.5
BM25S_IGNORE_ZERO=true
BM25S_CUTOFF=10.0
```

## Document loading

Load from a custom YAML file:

```python
from bm25s_retriever import BM25SRetriever

retriever = BM25SRetriever(document_file="path/to/your/tools_list.yaml")
```

Or add documents programmatically:

```python
from bm25s_retriever import BM25SRetriever, Document

retriever = BM25SRetriever()
retriever.add_documents([
    Document(
        id="custom_doc",
        title="Custom Document",
        content="Your searchable content here.",
        keywords=["tag1", "tag2"],
    )
])
```

After editing a YAML source file, reload the index manually:

```python
retriever.rebuild_index()
```

Or create a new retriever instance:

```python
retriever = BM25SRetriever()
```

### Dynamic tool injection

You can also add tool definitions at runtime. This is useful when your application starts with a YAML registry but discovers additional tools from MCP servers or other tool providers and wants those tools to participate in lexical retrieval.

```python
from bm25s_retriever import Document

retriever.add_documents([
    Document(
        id="mcp_get_account_summary",
        title="Get Account Summary",
        content="Retrieve account balances, buying power, positions, and account status from an MCP-discovered tool.",
        keywords=["account", "balances", "buying power", "positions"],
        metadata={
            "source": "mcp",
            "server": "brokerage_tools",
            "type": "tool",
        },
    )
])
```

Retrieved results include metadata, allowing the client or orchestrator to map the selected document back to the underlying tool provider, MCP server, or execution layer.

## Search tuning

The GitHub repo is useful for hands-on retrieval tuning. Run the demo UI locally with your own data to test temperature, softmax scoring, and cutoff settings, then refine your keywords and tool descriptions based on the ranked results.

### Stemming

The retriever uses PyStemmer to improve lexical recall across related word forms.

Examples:

- `trade`, `trading`, `traded`
- `invest`, `investing`, `investment`
- `order`, `orders`, `ordering`

### Temperature

- `0.1 - 0.5`: More focused and selective
- `0.5 - 1.5`: Balanced retrieval
- `1.5+`: Broader retrieval

Default: `0.5` in the sample configuration above. Tune based on your data and use case.

### Cutoff percentage

- `5 - 15%`: Typical range
- Lower values return more results
- Higher values return only stronger matches

Default: `10.0` in the sample configuration above. Tune based on your desired selectivity.

### Score interpretation

- `>20%`: Strong match
- `8-20%`: Good match
- `<8%`: Weak match
- `0%`: No lexical relevance

## Example scripts

### YAML file usage

```bash
python examples/load_yaml_documents.py
```

Covers:

- Loading custom YAML documents
- Search configuration
- Document management patterns

### REST API usage

```bash
bm25s-server --config settings.yaml
python examples/rest_api_examples.py
```

Covers:

- HTTP client operations
- REST-based document management
- Error handling patterns

### curl examples

```bash
bm25s-server --config settings.yaml
./scripts/curl_api_examples.sh
```

Covers:

- Command-line API operations
- Search, add, list, and delete endpoints

## REST API examples

Add a document:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9200/documents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "get_customer_orders",
    "title": "Get Customer Orders",
    "content": "Retrieve open, closed, priority, delayed, or historical customer orders.",
    "keywords": ["orders", "customer orders", "open orders", "order history"]
  }'
```

Search:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9200/retrieve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "show open customer orders", "temperature": 0.5}'
```

List documents:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9200/documents
```

Delete a document:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9200/documents/get_customer_orders
```

## Performance notes

Approximate guidance:

- **Small collections (<100 docs):** sub-second indexing, instant search
- **Medium collections (100-1,000 docs):** 1-3 second indexing, usually <100ms search
- **Larger collections (1,000+ docs):** 3-10 second indexing, roughly 100-500ms search depending on content size

Documents and the BM25S index are stored in memory for fast access.

Optimization tips:

- Keep `content` focused and specific
- Add realistic `keywords` that match how users ask questions
- Use lower temperature for more selective tool routing
- Use cutoff filtering to reduce noisy matches
- Use returned metadata in the client or orchestration layer for filtering, routing, display, policy checks, or downstream decisions
